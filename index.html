          Hi, I'm Liz. After years of working in healthcare as an athletic
          trainer and EMT, I discovered a passion for creating and
          problem-solving through code. I've since taught myself web
          development, focusing on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly
          websites. I'm excited to bring the same dedication and attention to
          detail from my healthcare experience into crafting meaningful digital
          experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me outdoors camping under the
          stars, lost in a suspenseful horror novel, or sketching and bringing
          my ideas to life on paper. I love combining creativity and curiosity,
          both in my hobbies and in the websites I build.
